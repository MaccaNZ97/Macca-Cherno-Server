    "Howdy, Partner, am I glad to see you!\r\n\r\nI've had a special request for some pest control, but of the wolf variety.\r\n\r\nThere's been a pack of particularly vicious wolves terrorising the folks of Myshkino and this pack is led by the legendary Silver Ghost, a white wolf.\r\n\r\nIf you can wipe out the entire pack, you be doing the people of Zolotar a great service, but taking out the Ghost, their leader should be enough to scatter the rest.\r\n\r\nBring me the white pelt and I'll pay you â‚½6000!\r\n\r\nKill the Wolfs with your Crossbow and a Hunting Bolt",
